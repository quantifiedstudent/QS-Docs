## Introduction

Quantified Student (QS for short) **Watch** is a component of the [Quantified Student](https://quantifiedstudent.nl/) system. The project is intended on the one hand to collect physical data from a student using smartwatches and on the other hand to provide performance insights to a student, generated from that collected data.

## Goal

The ultimate goal of Quantified Student, and thus QS Watch, is to use student data to improve their personal and educational performance. In the current context, this is achieved by collecting data on a student's physical performance using smartwatches (also known as smart bands).

In addition, this project will use the collected data to provide insight into the physical performance of that particular student and use this data to potentially improve the learning experience and performance across multiple forms of applications (e.g. web, mobile).

### Signal prediction and data extraction

An important goal of the proof of concept, in combination with the setup for the data extraction, is to prove or disprove that the collected data from the smartwatches can be used to predict various scenarios (e.g. stress).

### Security

Another goal is to ensure that the project is compliant with the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation). This means, among other things, that students get full ownership of their collected data and that the data cannot be viewed by other parties.

## Ecosystem

The role of QS Watch within the Quantified Student ecosystem is to provide a different stream of data that can be used for the various functions of the Quantified Student system.

## Users

The system will be used by the following users:

- Student(s), to wear the smartwatch and get an insight about their performance
