\section{Introduction}
When it comes to visualizing data and creating interactive graphs and charts in JavaScript, several powerful frameworks and libraries are available. These frameworks offer developers a range of tools and functionalities to effectively represent data in a visually appealing and engaging manner. 
Each framework has its strengths and caters to different development preferences and project requirements. By understanding their features, chart types, learning curves, customization options, and interactivity capabilities, we can make informed decisions on selecting the most suitable JavaScript framework for graph creation and data visualization.

\section{Goal}
Our primary objective is to select a framework that effectively and informatively presents students' data in the form of graphs on the dashboard of the Quantified Student project. In the following section, we outline the crucial requirements that the framework must meet to facilitate efficient and rapid development while meeting our specific needs.

\section{Requiremnts}
    \subsection{Simplicity}
    \textit{How easy is it to use and get started with the framework?}
    \smallbreak
    Simplifying the framework ensures that developers can quickly grasp the concepts and start building graphs without getting bogged down by complex implementation details. This speeds up the development process and reduces the learning curve, allowing developers to be more productive.
    \subsection{Automation}
    \textit{Does the framework provide automation features for simplifying chart creation?}
    \smallbreak

    By automating tasks like rendering, data manipulation, and interactivity, the framework reduces the amount of manual code that developers need to write. This saves time and effort, enabling faster development cycles and quicker iterations.
    \subsection{Customization}
    \textit{To what extent can charts be customized and tailored to specific needs?}
    \smallbreak
    The ability to customize charts according to specific needs is important for creating visually appealing and tailored visualizations. This aspect assesses the flexibility and options available for customizing the appearance, interactivity, and behavior of the charts.
    \subsection{Templates and Themes}
    \textit{Does the framework offer pre-designed templates and themes for quick styling?}
    \smallbreak
    Pre-designed templates and themes provide ready-to-use graph layouts and styles. Developers can leverage these resources to quickly create visually appealing graphs without having to start from scratch. This accelerates development by eliminating the need to spend time designing and fine-tuning the graph's visual presentation.
    \subsection{Efficient Data Handling}
    \textit{How well does the framework handle data manipulation and integration?}
    \smallbreak
    Handling large datasets efficiently is crucial for performance and responsiveness. With optimized algorithms and data processing mechanisms, the framework can handle complex graph data quickly and effectively. This ensures that developers can work with large amounts of data without experiencing slowdowns or bottlenecks, leading to faster development and better user experiences.
    \subsection{Responsive and Cross-Platform Support}
    \textit{Does the framework provide responsiveness for charts across different devices?}
    \smallbreak
    With the increasing variety of devices and screen sizes, the framework needs to adapt and display graphs correctly across different platforms. By providing responsive and cross-platform support, the framework enables developers to create graph visualizations that work seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This saves time by eliminating the need for manual adjustments and ensures a consistent user experience across platforms.
    \subsection{Performance}
    \textit{How efficiently does the framework handle rendering and interactivity?}
    \smallbreak
    A performant framework ensures that graphs render quickly and smoothly, even with complex data or real-time updates. Fast graph interactions contribute to a more efficient development workflow, as developers can iterate and test their graphs more rapidly without being hindered by slow rendering or laggy interactions.
    \subsection{Comprehensive Documentation}
    \textit{Is the framework well-documented with clear examples and tutorials?}
    \smallbreak
    Comprehensive and well-organized documentation is essential for developers to understand and utilize the framework effectively. This aspect evaluates the quality and availability of documentation, including clear examples, tutorials, and API references.
    \subsection{FOSS (Free and Open Source)}
    \textit{Is the framework freely available and open source for community use?}
    \smallbreak
    The free and open-source aspect considers whether the framework is freely available and open-source, enabling community involvement, contributions, and customization without any licensing restrictions.
